## Description

This project aims to make README's easier to create by taking input from a user and self generating a generalized README file.

## Reason for creation

I'm going to be honest here. I HATE creating README's for things that aren't complicated where a README file could honestly be unnecassary. Created out of hate.

## Usage

Only way to use, is by cloning the repo, then installing inquirer, then launching within a terminal

## Issues

WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options

THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
